## Process and Design

* To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
 -Why visitors come to your site?
  -What is the specific goals of the visitors?

* Using a sitemap and wireframe you can draft your website before writing any code.
 -A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.
It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
