## Process and Design

* To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
 1.Why visitors come to your site?
 1.What is the specific goals of the visitors?

* Using a sitemap and wireframe you can draft your website before writing any code.

 `A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.
It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require`

`A sitemap acts as a roadmap of your website that leads the user to all your important pages.`
