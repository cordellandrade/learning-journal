            Cordell's Grooming Services offers a relaxed atmosphere, and caters to all your dogs needs.
            Your pet will be treated as one of our own and receive the care and attention your pet deserves. 
            <br>
            <br>While your pet is at the grooming shed they will have the time to rest, stretch their legs in the garden
            and have a drink of water, so their experience with us is enjoyable.
