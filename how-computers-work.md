# How Computers work

## What makes up a computer:

- Any device that takes input, stores information, processes the info and gives an output is referred as a computer.

## Computers use Data & Binary
Computers uses a binary number system working with only 1's and 0's while using electic wires that carry the info.

## Circuits and Wires 

- Computers are electronic devices using wires and circuits to input data, store that data, process it, then give an output of that processing.
 -CPU;
 1.The CPU is the master controller of the computer, using a <em>control unit</em> to control flow of data.
 1. <em>ALU Unit</em> to perform arithmetric , logical and operational calculations.
 1. <em>Registers </em> to stores data until further use.

### Binary 

- Using a binary number system, computers use only two digits, 1's and 0's.

- Using numbers to represent text, pictures, and videos.
