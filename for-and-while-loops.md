# FOR and WHILE Loops

- For loops; If you need to run code a specific numbers of times, use a FOR loop.

- While loops; If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop.

-Do While loop; The do while loops is similiar to the "While" loop but the only difference is that it will always run statements inside the curly braces at least once.

-Each loops repeats a set of statements.
