# Javascript Notes

## What is Javascript?
- JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language now being used for increasingly complex web development.
  - Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the first language learned by self-taught coders eager to learn and build. 

There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript:
1. strings - Characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String' 
1. numbers - Any number without quotes: 23.8879
1. booleans - Only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). 
It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
1. null - Represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null 
(without quotes).

1. undefined - Denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). 
It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.
1. symbol - A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. 
No need to worry about these for now.
1. object - Collections of related data.
The first 6 of those types are considered primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the language.
 Objects are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. 


## console.log();
- The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly. 

- In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. 
-Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language.

- One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. When we write console.log() 
what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console. 

## Commenting
- A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it. You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of code:

- A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.
